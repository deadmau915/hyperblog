An awesome blog for the Git and Github course in Platzi

>This repo is just an exercise of the recently acquired new skills using git and github

In this course I learned about:
* how git and github works
* create and merge branches
* move back and forward in the commits
* how git is used in the profesional software development
* how to fork a repo and how to make push request to those repos

This **readme.md** was designed while I was taking the course in platzi, It's just to see how the readme file will look in github, **not a real exercise of one**
